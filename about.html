	<h1>About this page</h1>
	<p class="aboutTxt">
	I wanted to find a way to show my appreciation for the game series by making something different from everyone else. As I really like both game music and programming I came up with this which combines both things into one.
	By making a webpage quiz I was also able to learn how to create my own website which is the reason I decided to make it a webpage application.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p class="aboutTxt">
	I therefore decided to submit this for the "Thank You Zero Escape" project which was made 28 June 2016 to show Kotaro Uchikoshi and Spike Chunsoft how much everyone appreciated the game series. 
	By making the quiz I would also praise Shinji Hosoe for creating this amazing music which really set the mood of the game.

	<p class="aboutTxt">
	The page will still be up for as long as possible to bring joy to all the fans of the Zero Escape series and everyone of this wonderful communities both on Facebook and Twitter.
