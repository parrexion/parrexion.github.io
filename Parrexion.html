	<p class="aboutTxt">
	I've making games my whole life. 
	But it wasn't video games until 6th grade when me and my friend started with Game Maker. 
	We made some things which wasn't really games but it was fun anyway.
	In high school, Dice Fighters was my final project and most of the basics of Dice Fighters 
	was done at that time.
	<br><br>
	I later started working on it again at university level as I've learned a lot of programming. 
	There was a lot to correct and improve upon but I finally feel like it's time to move on.
	<br><br>
	The next project will be a new game which is probably gonna require several people to finish. 
	Look forward to that.
