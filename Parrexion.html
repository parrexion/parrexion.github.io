	<h2>Gamedev journey</h2>
	<p class="aboutTxt">
	I've making games my whole life all the way back in elementary when I was making up different 
	games of make believe I would play together with my two brothers and friends. Once I sat down 
	in Gamemaker 6 in 6th grade I was hooked by programming. I didn't really make any real video games 
	until high school when I made a complete digital board game as my high school project. 
	<br> But it wasn't until the last year of university that I actually realised that I could be 
	working on making video games full time that I started taking it seriously. I found a job at Zordix 
	making racing games for about 4 years using Unity. 
	But now I'm at the point that I want to try to go full indie instead.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Work experience</h2>
	<p class="aboutTxt">
	4 years of working on games in Unity at Zordix and Zordix Racing which also included some javascript for handling the servers. 
	Leart a lot of Java in university but haven't worked on a commersial project using it so far.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Favourite games</h2>
	<p class="aboutTxt">
	For me, what's important in games is the experience itself. That is both the story, the challenge and, last but not least, the music. 
	<br>The story is important because video games tells stories in a completely different way from all other mediums.
	<br>The challenge is important because I'm a problem solver and solving difficult and interesting tasks gives me a kick.
	<br>The music is also important because it always directly connects to my emotions.
	<br><br> My top 3 consists of "The World Ends With You", "Ace Attorney: Trials and Tribulations", and "Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward".
