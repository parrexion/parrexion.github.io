		for a long time. On one of the contested planets humans have established a base and is 
		trying to survive and fight off the other faction. In order to fight back, they have

	<h2>GAMEPLAY</h2>
	<img src="images/thr/battle_on.png" class="banner_image">
	<p class="dicefighters_body">
		The gameplay for the game is similar to a typical RPG. The player will move around 
		in the world talking to people and doing quest. When encountering enemies the battles 
		take place in an area different from the normal world. From battles the player will 
		gain experience and money to buy better equipment.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p class="dicefighters_body">
		The difference from most RPGs is that battles are played out using 2 characters 
		simultaneously, the soldier and the android. The android is the main fighter and is 
		controlled with the mouse and shift key. You move around and make gestures with the 
		mouse to do different attacks. From battles you can acquire new attacks to use with the 
		android.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p class="dicefighters_body">
		The soldier plays more of a supporting role and is controlled with the keyboard. 
		The soldier does not move but blocks or evades attacks instead. It fights using a laser 
		weapon which can overheat so it is important to take time to cool it down. The soldier 
		can get different kinds of equipment to change up how the weapon works and assist them 
		both in battles.
