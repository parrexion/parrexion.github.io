		Dice Confrontation is a Collectible Dice Game. 
		That means it plays very similar to a collectible card game but with the catch that 
		all the cards have been replaced with 6-sided dice. This gives the game a completely different feel 
		since each die can show a different side every time you play with them.
		<br><br>
		The game has multiplayer against other players by creating games on the server right now but might 
		be changed to joining hosting players instead to save on server costs. 
		There is also a big tutorial for learning the game which takes about 20-30 minutes to complete and 
		a single player mode where you can test out decks against an AI opponent.

	<h2>How to play</h2>
	<p class="left_body">
		The objective of the game is to win the war represented by the game. 
		The war is fought on 3 battlefields and the player that can conquer a majority of them is the winner 
		once the time is up. Each turn the current player get 3 actions they can use to play dice from their 
		hand to influence the battlefields. This includes both Soldiers placed into battalions on the battlefields and Warcry and Tactics which changes the soldiers already placed. 
		The players keep taking turns until a set number of turns have passed. 
		At that point, you tally up the strength of the soldiers on each battlefield and the player that 
		wins a majority of the battles are declared the winner.

	<h2>Commanders</h2>
	<p class="left_body">
		There is a special kind of soldiers in the game called Commanders which are more expensive to play 
		but have powerful effects that can turn the tide of the battles and are definitely something to 
		build your armies around. This includes effects such as:
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Gaining strength for each soldier of a certain colour.</li>
			<li>Giving strength to each soldier played.</li>
			<li>Killing the strongest soldier in the war.</li>
			<li>Rerolling all the soldiers placed, causing chaos.</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>Almost 200 different dice!</h2>
	<p class="left_body">
		Before playing a match in Dice Confrontation you need to select an army of dice to use. 
		These armies are like your deck of cards that contains all the dice you are going to be using 
		during the match. When playing the game for the first time you get a bunch of pre-built armies 
		so that you can immedeately jump into a game but at some point you might want to build your own army.
		<br><br>
		There is an army builder in the game which you can use to construct your own armies. 
		An army consists of 30 dice. You can have 2 of each die except Commanders which you can only use 1 
		of each. There are 6 different colours representing different factions with their own strengths 
		and weaknesses which gives them some character.

	<h2>Possible additional features</h2>
	<p class="left_body">
		Due to being a solo developer I have not been able to implement all the features I wanted of in game as of now and given time and resources I would have liked to have these as well.
		<br><br>
		An actual collection. Since it is a collectible game there needs to be some way of getting new 
		dice and have a collection. Right now you just get all the dice in the game from the start which 
		is very useful for trying the game out but removes the feeling of having something to strive for 
		when playing the game.
		<br><br>
		Proper matchmaking and online handling. There are some features missing or being very rough around  the online multiplayer part of the game. Right now there is no ranked mode or random matchmaking as players will have to manually find opponents. There is also no way to reconnect players to a game and the handling of disconnections and errors are very rough and uninformative.
		<br><br>
		Spectating. Spectating other players' game is something which would make it much easier to build 
		a community since it would allow for sharing of strategies and making tournaments.
